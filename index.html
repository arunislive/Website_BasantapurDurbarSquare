                    <strong>Construction and Builders:</strong><br>
                    Basantapur Durbar Square was built by the Malla kings, who ruled over the Kathmandu Valley from
                    the 12th to the 18th century. The square and its surrounding structures were constructed over
                    several centuries, with each successive king contributing to its expansion and embellishment.
                    The intricate craftsmanship and architectural splendor of Basantapur Durbar Square are a
                    testament to the skill and ingenuity of the Newari artisans who worked tirelessly to bring the
                    royal vision to life.

                    <strong>Duration of Construction:</strong><br>
                    The construction of Basantapur Durbar Square spanned several hundred years, beginning in the
                    early Malla period and continuing through successive dynasties. While exact records of the
                    construction timeline are scarce, historical accounts suggest that the square and its key
                    structures were gradually developed and expanded over the course of approximately 300 to 400
                    years. This prolonged construction period allowed for the incorporation of diverse architectural
                    styles and artistic influences, resulting in the breathtaking ensemble of palaces, temples, and
                    courtyards that define Basantapur Durbar Square today.
